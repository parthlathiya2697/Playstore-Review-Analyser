Regardless of their employment circumstances, a person's attitude relates to their general perspective and manner. It can be either good or negative. For instance, even if someone has a positive outlook and tries to see the bright side of things, they may still not love their work because of things like a challenging workplace, a lack of fulfilment or purpose in their work, or a lack of prospects for progress.
